# Question 1

In the assignment, you had to create a `MessageHandler` interface. Please answer the following two questions:

1. Describe the benefits of using this `MessageHandler` interface. (~50-100 words)
2. Instead of creating an implementation of `MessageHandler` that invokes a command handler, we could also pass the command handler to the client/server directly without the middle man of the `MessageHandler` implementation. What are the implications of this? (~50-100 words)

___

**Answer**:
___

# Question 2

One of your colleagues wrote the following class:

```java
public class RookieImplementation {

    private final Car car;

    public RookieImplementation(Car car) {
        this.car = car;
    }

    public void carEventFired(String carEvent) {
        if("steer.left".equals(carEvent)) {
            car.steerLeft();
        } else if("steer.right".equals(carEvent)) {
            car.steerRight();
        } else if("engine.start".equals(carEvent)) {
            car.startEngine();
        } else if("engine.stop".equals(carEvent)) {
            car.stopEngine();
        } else if("pedal.gas".equals(carEvent)) {
            car.accelerate();
        } else if("pedal.brake".equals(carEvent)) {
            car.brake();
        }
    }
}
```

# Question 3

You have the following exchange with a colleague:

> **Colleague**: "Hey, look at this! It's super handy. Pretty simple to write custom experiments."

```java
class Experiments {
    public static Model runExperimentA(DataTable dt) {
        CommandHandler commandSequence = new CleanDataTableCommand()
            .setNext(new RemoveCorrelatedColumnsCommand())
            .setNext(new TrainSVMCommand())

        Config config = new Options();
        config.set("broadcast", true);
        config.set("svmdatatable", dt);

        commandSequence.handle(config);

        return (Model) config.get("svmmodel");
    }

    public static Model runExperimentB() {
        CommandHandler commandSequence = new CleanDataTableCommand()
            .setNext(new TrainSGDCommand())

        Config config = new Options();
        config.set("broadcast", true);
        config.set("sgddatatable", dt);

        commandSequence.handle(config);

        return (Model) config.get("sgdmodel");
    }
}
```

> **Colleague**: "I could even create this method to train any of the models we have. Do you know how Jane did it?"

```java
class Processor {
    public static Model getModel(String algorithm, DataTable dt) {
        CommandHandler commandSequence = new TrainSVMCommand()
            .setNext(new TrainSDGCommand())
            .setNext(new TrainRFCommand())
            .setNext(new TrainNNCommand())

        Config config = new Options();
        config.set("broadcast", false);
        config.set(algorithm + "datatable", dt);

        commandSequence.handle(config);

        return (Model) config.get(algorithm + "model");
    }
}
```

> **You**: "Sure! She is using the command pattern. Easy indeed."
>
> **Colleague**: "Yeah. But look again. There is more; she uses another pattern on top of it. I wonder how it works."

1. What is this other pattern? What advantage does it provide to the solution? (~50-100 words)

2. You know the code for `CommandHandler` has to be a simple abstract class in this case, probably containing four methods:
- `CommandHandler setNext(CommandHandler next)` (implemented in `CommandHandler`),
- `void handle(Config config)` (implemented in `CommandHandler`),
- `abstract boolean canHandle(Config config)`,
- `abstract void execute(Config config)`.

Please provide a minimum working example of the `CommandHandler` abstract class.
